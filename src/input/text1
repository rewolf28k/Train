HashMap is a class in the java.utils package that implements the Map interface. It is used to store the key-value pair. Letâ€™s suppose we need to store the stock prices of some companies. In this case, we can use a HashMap. The company name will be the key and the stock price will be the value.

Some of the features of HashMap are:

The keys should be unique.
HashMap allows only one null key.
The values can be null or duplicate.
The keys are stored in random order.
