Let’s consider creating a LinkedHashMap that stores the student information. The key is the id of the student and the value is the name of the student.

We are inserting our first record, 123; “Roy” in LinkedHashMap on the tail. The following process will occur:

The hash of 123 will be calculated and based on the hash value, a bucket will be decided. Let’s say the bucket is 5.
An Entry object is created with the key as 123 and the value as Roy. The before and after fields are set to null as this is the first record.
Since there is no element in the LinkedHashMap, both the head and tail variables are null. Now both these variables will point towards the newly created Entry.
